# What will group1 and group2 become after executing this program? Please write them down in the following lines (without actually running this program).
# group1: 
# group2: 

# Then you want to write all the keys and the square root of their corresponding values in group3 into the 1-th dictionary of group2 (e.g. if there is a key ’tom’ whose value is 4, then you need to write a key ‘tom’ whose value is the square root of 4 into group2). Write your codes to achieve this.
